# Pizza Sales Analysis

This project involves analyzing a pizza sales dataset using SQL. It answers essential business questions such as customer ordering patterns, revenue generation, and the performance of different pizza types and categories.


# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights from a pizza sales database using structured SQL queries. These insights can help a pizza business optimize operations, enhance product offerings, and improve sales strategies.


# Database Tables

- *orders*: Contains order ID, order date, and order time.
- *order_details*: Contains the quantity of each pizza ordered.
- *pizzas*: Contains pizza ID, size, price, and type ID.
- *pizza_types*: Contains pizza name, category, and type ID.


# Key SQL Queries and Insights

1. **Average Number of Pizzas Ordered Per Day**
Groups orders by date and calculates the average number of pizzas sold daily.

2. **Category-wise Distribution of Pizzas**
Displays the count of pizza types in each category (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Chicken).

3. **Most Common Pizza Size**
Identifies the most frequently ordered pizza size.

4. **Cumulative Revenue Over Time**
Calculates total revenue day by day and visualizes how it grows over time.

5. **Highest-Priced Pizza**
Lists the most expensive pizza on the menu.

6. **Top 3 Pizzas by Revenue**
Finds the top three pizzas that generated the highest revenue.

7. **Orders by Hour of the Day**
Analyzes customer ordering behavior based on time.

8. **Revenue Contribution by Pizza Category**
Calculates how much each pizza category contributes to total sales in percentage.

9. **Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types**
Displays the five most popular pizzas based on quantity ordered.

10. **Top 3 Pizzas per Category (Revenue-Based)**
Ranks the top 3 pizzas in each category based on revenue generated.

11. **Total Quantity by Pizza Category**
Shows which pizza categories have the highest sales volume.

12. **Total Number of Orders**
Provides the overall number of orders placed.

13. **Total Revenue**
Calculates the overall revenue generated from pizza sales.
